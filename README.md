# Cub3D

A ray-casting-based 3D engine and first-person maze exploration built in C.

## 🧠 Overview

**Cub3D** is a graphical project from the 42 School curriculum that challenges you to build a simple 3D game engine from scratch.  
Inspired by classic first-person shooters like *Wolfenstein 3D*, this project uses the **ray casting** technique to render a 3D-like environment from a 2D map — all implemented in plain **C** with the **MiniLibX** graphics library.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time 3D rendering using ray casting
- Keyboard controls for player movement
- Map parsing and validation
- Collision detection
- Texture and color rendering
- Basic lighting and depth effect

## 🛠️ Build & Run

To compile and run the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ali-ezghari/Cub3D.git
cd Cub3D
make
./cub3D path/to/your_map.cub
